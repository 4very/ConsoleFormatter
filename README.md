# ConsoleFormatter

A pretty console formatter/outputer wrapped as a D&D initiave tracker as a proof of concept.

## PLANNED FEATURES
* Asynchronous updating of the format while still preserving input capabilities
* Wide range of formats to display, i.e. Tables/Text/Multiple Choice
* Clean terminal output that does not fill up the console
* Saving, Loading, and Updating of predefined screen settings
